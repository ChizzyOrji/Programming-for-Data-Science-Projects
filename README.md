# Programming-for-Data-Science-Projects
Simple Pure Python code projects
This programming task focuses on using Python to calculate a set of standard statistical measures for a given dataset using built-in functions and data structures ONLY.
No Python library functions was imported. This means that Python modules such as math or libraries such as Pandas, NumPy or SciPy were not used. The file used for this task is name task1.

For task 2,this programming task focuses on using NumPy/SciPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib/Seaborn to combine, clean and analyse two datasets related to bias crime.
Two data files have been provided for this task.
The task2a.csv data file contains background information about residents of 51 regions including wages, race, education, income inequality and voting record.
The task2b.csv data file contains information about bias crimes (per 100,000 residents) for each region.
